A Foundry VTT Module to add GM-Only notes to JournalEntries.
This module is system independet, but has an additional feature to easily move GM notes to JournalEntrys content.

This fork has some graphical adjustments and restricts the gm notes to JournalEntries, so it was easy to enable the gm buttons for all systems
